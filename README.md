Description
-----------

ofxJitterVideoSender is an an implementation of the Cycling '74's [Jitter Networking Specification](http://cycling74.com/sdk/MaxSDK-6.0.4/html/chapter_jit_networking.html).  It allows users to send video frames and messages to Jitter from openFrameworks.

You may be better off using [ofxSyphon](https://github.com/astellato/ofxSyphon) to share video frames and OSC to send messages back and forth.  But, if you need to use [jit.net.send]/[jit.net.recv] then this is your addon.

OpenFrameworks is a cross platform open source toolkit for creative coding in C++.
